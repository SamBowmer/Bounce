Bounce

Really simple HTML and JS program written by Sam Bowmer and improved by Sam Hornsey
that recreates the bouncy bouncy screensaver thingy of a certain trademarked optical 
media using JS's elem.style.transform (formerly "requestAnimationFrame()"). 

Tested on Chrome but should work on other browsers.
